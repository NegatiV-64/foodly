# Foodly Frontend

This is the frontend part for the Foodly project. It uses Next.js and React. As an exeperiment, it uses `app` directory, that was added in Next.js 13.

## Requirements

1. Postgres database. You can download it from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2. Node.js 16+. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
3. Git. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

I guess that's it. If you have any problems, please open an issue.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository. You can do it by running `git clone` + URL of the repository. You can find the URL by clicking on the green button that says "Code".
2. After cloning, you need to install all the dependencies for the backend part of the project. You can read more about the installation process in the README.md file in the backend directory.
3. If you successfully installed the backend part, you can start to install the frontend part. You can do it by running `npm install` in the root directory of the frotend project.
4. Only after all the dependencies are installed, you can run the project. You can do it by running `npm run dev` in the root directory of the frontend project. Don't forget to run the backend part of the project as well by running `npm run server` in the root directory of the frontend project or by running `npm run dev` in the root directory of the backend project. If you don't run the backend part, you won't be able to see any data on the frontend part.
5. Have fun!

## Technologies

- Next.js. I am using Next13. In particular, I am using the `app` directory, that was added in Next.js 13. It is a new feature in Next13 and it is in beta. Since it is a university project, it is a good opportunity to try it out. But don't use it in production, because it is in beta. You can read more about it [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/src-directory).
- React. I am using React 18. The `app` directory gives me the opportunity to use React Server Components. You can read more about it [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/server-components.html).
- Tailwind CSS. It is a utility-first CSS framework. You can read more about it [here](https://tailwindcss.com/).
